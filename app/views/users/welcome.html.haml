    You're here because you want to become a better writer and communicator. Verba is here to help.

    Here's how Verba works:

  %p.col-md-6
    You'll be receiving a daily e-mail with a writing prompt to get you started if you aren't feeling particularly inspired. When you log in, you simply begin writing, either using the prompt or your own topic. You could talk about what you are going to do during your day or an issue that you have had on your mind.
    Verba supports writing in Markdown for formatting your posts.
    We'll keep track of some key stats including word count, number of posts, and a streak of days that you wrote.
    Your writing is private by default, but you may choose to publish a post and get feedback from other writers in the community.
