  %h1.hero-title Write every day.
  %p.hero-subheading.col-sm-7.text-center Verba helps you become a better writer by reminding you to write and tracking your progress.

  %ul.about-list.flex-center--column.col-sm-6
    %h2 Here's how it works:
    %li.about-list__item
      We send you a writing prompt every day. Feel free to write about whatever you want, the prompt is only there to help you if you can't think of anything to write about.
    %li.about-list__item
      We'll keep track of a few key stats including word count and streaks of consecutive days that you write. Consistency is the name of the game.

    %li.about-list__item
      If you need some additional motivation, you can earn badges for reaching certain milestones, like keeping up a writing streak of five days.

    %li.about-list__item
      Your posts are private by default, but you may choose to publish them to the Verba community. Share your work and get feedback.
